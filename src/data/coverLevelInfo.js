        description: `Third party cover is the most basic form of car insurance and is the legal minimum requirement for drivers. As the name suggests, it just covers injuries or damage to third parties:
        
        Injuries to other people, passengers or animals.
        Damage to other people's property.
        Accidents caused by a passenger or a named driver on your policy.
        Any passengers in your car who are injured in a collision where you're at fault.
        As such, third party car insurance won't cover the repairs for your own car, an injury to you, or replacement costs if your car is lost because it has been stolen or is destroyed by fire.

        name:'Third Party, Fire and Theft (TPFT) Insurance',
        description: `Third party, fire, and theft insurance – often called TPFT – provides some additional cover to third party insurance:

        If your car is stolen, damaged or written off by fire.
        In some cases, damage caused by an attempted theft (as long as you aren't at fault).
        As with third party only, you aren't covered for damage to your car or an injury you might suffer if it is your own fault.
        
        Third party or third party, fire and theft car insurance can sometimes be the cheapest option, and may appear attractive to young drivers who have older, low value cars. However, young drivers are seen by insurers as high-risk and as a result the cost of third-party options can be more expensive than a comprehensive policy. Plus, not every insurer offers third party or third party, fire and theft insurance.

        name:'Comprehensive Insurance',
        description: `You can expect comprehensive car insurance policies to cover everything included in TPFT insurance, but it can also cover damage done to your car.

        Some policies may also provide cover for your windscreen, personal contents such as a sat-nav, medical costs (up to a specified amount), using a trailer fixed to your car, while others might include a courtesy car or include comprehensive cover if you drive your car outside the UK.
        
        Not all will include these benefits while others may offer them at an additional cost so it is important that you check that the policy you choose includes everything that you want or expect it to.
